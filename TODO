Need a class to obsfucate the puzzle
This will take a puzzle and generate a new 2d array that has the values plus a boolean take to represent visibility/changeability


Genetic Algorithm
    fitness function
    population size
    probability of crossover
    probability of mutation
    number of elite?

I guess this will have puzzles as parents a child will be a merged puzzle
How do I represent the puzzle:
    solutionString -> list/array:Need to add function to verify column, row and section conditions and used in the fitness function
                      How do I crossover puzzles? Fixed values can not change, we iterate over the parent grids and
                      do a 50/50 chance to select either one
